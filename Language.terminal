Terminal_Knife = 	
					"\cnCOMBAT KNIFE \n\n"  
					"\cjA military-grade titanium knife. It is a sturdy cutting tool, and well-balanced enough for throwing. The laser-sharpened edge is able to inflict grievous wounds easily, which can lead to further potential damage such as an internal bleeding.\n\nIt´s light weight and blade design allow the knife to be a very versatile hand-to-hand combat weapon, not being very difficult to handle and even allowing the user to pull it out quickly and throw a surprise slash at any enemy that might lunge too close to them.\n\nOn the other hand, it´s electrically isolated handle makes it useful for cutting electric wires and remove screws from crates and vents, always at the risk of damaging the blade though.";

Terminal_Axe = 	
					"\cnFIRE AXE \n\n"  
					"\cjA generic firefighting tool. It is a commonplace item around UAC establishments. The most common axe models include a carbon-fiber haft, increasing their endurance while reducing manufacturing cost as compared to the traditional wood axes. The axe's head remains pure steel, however, and is suitable for cutting and rending apart most obstacles found inside UAC facilities, save for the reinforced bulkheads and the like.\n\nEven though it´s a bulkier melee weapon when compared with the knife, the axe´s raw power when delivering a huge slash is unmatched. Often enough to tear a human in half, a knowing user would try to balance the stamina consumption with precise, powerful hits.\n\nAs opposed to the knife, the axe´s long blade and shape allows for it to be used as a lever to force vent hatches and even metal, sealed doors open. Be aware that the bigger the strength required, the more damaged the blade will get.";
