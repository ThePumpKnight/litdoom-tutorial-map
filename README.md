## SECTIONS
The map is divided into 4 different sections, each one accessible via a teleporter at the beginning of the level. The user can freely roam from one another with the exception of the shooting range, which will finish the level once completed. From right to left, the sections are:

`Ammo & Weapons`: Designated with red glowing orbs, this is a section dedicated to the showcase of the weapons and ammunition related to the latest, publicly announced UAC-made weaponry. The UAC reserves the right to showcase experimental weapons and prototypes of whatever origin and age.

`Health & Armor`: Designated with green glowing orbs, this section showcases some of the UACÂ´s first aid items and utilities for healthcare and inmediate treatment of wounds. It also showcases different armors used by our employees and associates, ranging from light vests to heavy armors.

`Items & Crafting`: Designated with blue glowing orbs, this section showcases the advanced UAC portable crafting systems, such as the Recombiner; alongside a description of the items usually employed alongside it to create powerful, 100% gluten free stimulants! Parental warning: keep out of range of children.

`Shooting Range`: Designated with two floor lamps, this quick travel through this virtual environment will allow the user to get his hands on some of the most well-known weaponry produced by the UAC. Note: only one use per user input, to avoid encouragement of using firearms on real human targets.

We hope you enjoy this awesome virtual trip to understand the complexity of our work, here at the UAC, and t319271314666666-
